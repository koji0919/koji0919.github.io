<meta name="description" content="Ramium is an awesome hugo theme for creating personal blogs. Apparently, none of the existing hugo themes were what I wanted them to be for my new blog. Or maybe I just could not find the right one. So I took upon the courtesy of making the perfect one for my own. And thus takes the birth of Ramium that I&rsquo;m very proud of. Coding this theme has been very fun.
Special thanks go to Hugo, which is not only the world’s fastest framework for building websites but an amazing one as well. This theme exists because Hugo exists. Also a big thanks to Bulma, which is an open source CSS framework based on Flexbox. It was eye refreshing to see a site with layouts not from bootstrap.
